# DaemonBite 3DO USB Controller adapter
## Introduction
With this simple to build  adapter you can connect a 3DO gamepad (specifically tested using a Panasonic FZ-JP1 controller) to a PC, Raspberry PI, MiSTer FPGA etc. The Arduino Pro Micro has very low lag when configured as a USB gamepad and it is plug n' play once it has been programmed.

Only one controller is currently supported.

The headphone jack is not supported.

## Parts you need
- Arduino Pro Micro (ATMega32U4)
- Male DB9 plug
- Wire
- Heat shrink tube (Ã˜ ~20mm)
- Micro USB cable

## Wiring
Male DB9 socket pins (look at the pins in the socket):
